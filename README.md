# Jellymancer
This is a coffee-break roguelike, in development for the 7 Day Roguelike competition.

You play as a Jelly, and eat the other monsters on the level to get bigger.

Start the game by starting `Jellymancer.exe`.

It is finished in terms of a prototype.

Can be built with Monogame and VS 2015.
