This is a coffee-break roguelike, in development for the 7 Day Roguelike competition.

It's unfinished, it's in development, it may never be finished.

Currently to be treated as shared - not open-source. This means that it is still Â© Copyright Lachlan Kingsford 2017, but you can see the source and compile it yourself. I reserve the right to change this in the future.

Can be built with Monogame and VS 2015.
